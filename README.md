# codex

This repository is a scratchpad for experiments.

## Random musings
- Sometimes the best variable names are chosen by rolling a pair of dice and picking the most whimsical option.
- Coffee stains on notebooks are just accidental constellations waiting to be interpreted.
- Remember: `git commit --amend` is a time machine, but one that prefers responsible travelers.

## TODO
- [ ] Figure out why the original README only said `tt`.
- [ ] Celebrate once the mystery is solved.
